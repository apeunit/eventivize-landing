<Section isLeading>

Together, we want to build a space for young and talented artists to be recognized and rewarded in the competitive world of live events.

We believe that artists are important, and should be acknowledged for their talent, vision, and passion. That’s why we made Eventivize, to redefine the event-ecosystem, and put artists first.

<Section title="The Drops" note="Value-holding transferable tokens">

- #### Where to get them?
  Upon buying an event ticket, audience members will receive drops via an app. Additionally, they can receive drops when making select purchases and attending activities before and throughout the event. The audience can be credited with drops for participating in workshops, volunteering, and engaging with the live-stream (decided by the organizer).

- #### How much are they worth?
  The drops’ monetary value is set by the organizers who implement our token system. By transferring a monetary value, Eventivize becomes an interactive and transparent way for an audience to donate to artists, based on their performances. This way, emerging artists with amazing performances are awarded additional income.

- #### How to use them?
  Via an app where the audience can both receive and donate their drops. In the app, audience members can reward their favorite artists at the event.
